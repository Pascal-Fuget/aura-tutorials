# Part 4 - API-first development exprience

## Tutorial Flow

In this tutorial, we will go through the following flow:

* Associate API descriptor with the microservice (from the Admin console)
* Generate Javascript lib (from the Admin console)
* TBD - Create a new client microservice to use the generated JS library to access the backend rest API
* TBD - Deploy this new client microservice with Istio enabled (using Wercker)
* TBD - Access the new client microservice
* TBD - Observe the microservice behaviour (in Vizceral, Zipkin, Grafana)

## Steps

### Associate API descriptor with the microservice (from the Admin console)
