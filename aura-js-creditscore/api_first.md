# Part 4 - API-first development exprience

## Tutorial Flow

In this tutorial, we will go through the following flow:

* Associate API descriptor with the microservice (from the Admin console)
* Generate Javascript lib (from the Admin console)
	![Part 4a](images/Part-4-a.png)
* TBD - Create a new client microservice to use the generated JS library to access the backend rest API
* TBD - Deploy this new client microservice with Istio enabled (using Wercker)
	![Part 4b](images/Part-4-b.png)
* TBD - Access the new client microservice
* TBD - Observe the microservice behaviour (in Vizceral, Zipkin, Grafana)
